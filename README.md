# COP3330-Assignment 0
Knightro is planning on visiting one of UCF's satellite campuses in Daytona Beach.  While he is there, he is planning on doing a few fun things.   He has the choice of doing three things.   The first is to visit the beach.  The second activity is for him to play disc golf in Tuscawilla Park which is almost across the street.  Lastly, he could visit the International Speedway and count down how many laps are left in the race.

In your program, you will need to create a menu that asks the user for which option they want to do.   Number the options from 1-3 and the user will input an integer.  Have a 4th option which will be exit.  If they enter a 4, end the loop which should end the program.   Do NOT use an exit command.

If he decides to visit the beach, then ask the user what time is it in a 24 hour clock.   If it is between 9am and 6pm (9 to 18 on a 24 hour clock), he is allowed to drive on the beach.  If it isn't then print the beach is closed. 

If Knightro decides to play disc golf, assign the distance to your favorite prime number that is in between 300-500.   Tell the user how far away they are away from the basket.  Ask them how far they threw and update the distance from the basket.   If they over throw from the basket, the distance should remain positive.   End the loop once the disc is in the basket (distance is 0)

Lastly, if he choose to visit the speed way, ask how many laps are left.   Then print out a countdown of the laps.
